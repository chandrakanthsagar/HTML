    <h1>Media Query Demo</h1>
    <p id="p1">A media query demo is a visual representation of how web page styles and layouts can change based on different conditions defined by media queries. Media queries are a feature in CSS that allow you to apply different styles or rules based on certain characteristics of the device or viewport, such as screen size, resolution, or orientation.In a media query demo, you can expect to see different styles being applied when the conditions specified in the media queries are met. For example, the font size, colors, layout, or positioning of elements may change when the viewport width is below a certain threshold or when the device is in landscape mode.</p>
<p>A media query demo typically showcases how the appearance and layout of a web page adapt and respond to different devices or screen sizes. It helps web developers and designers ensure that their websites are responsive and provide an optimal user experience across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.By using media queries, web developers can create responsive designs that adjust seamlessly to different devices, allowing users to view and interact with the website effectively regardless of the screen size or device they are using.</p>
